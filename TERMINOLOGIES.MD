To best evaluate a model's performance in terms of accuracy, one must always evaluate
based on a baseline skill.
For Classification problems, the baseline is the naive score
For regrssion problems, the mean value is the naive score
In context of classification, a naive model is one that predicts all test data to be one
of the target labels and hence, the number of naive predictions depends on the number of labels in the dataset
