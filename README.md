# Learning-Machine_Learning
Simple highly commented python scripts on some very basic machine learning such as the regression line and training of classifiers. The tutorial followed is a great series of ML videos on the youtube channel SENTDEX. i highly recommend that you subscribe.
The general direction is to start with supervised algorithms, Linear regression, K-nearest neighbours and SVM. then later, unsupervised algorithms such as K-Means.
The comments are more of what ive understood and explanantion of some of the logic
